## On Life?

>We could never have loved the earth so well if we had had no childhood in it, if it were not the earth where the same flowers come up again every spring that we used to gather with our tiny fingers as we sat lisping to ourselves on the grass, the same hips and haws on the autumn hedgerows, the same redbreasts that we used to call ‘God’s birds’ because they did no harm to the precious crops. What novelty is worth that Sweet Monotony where everything is known and loved because it is known?    - George Eliot

DISCLAIMER: Following work not intended to be Grandiloquent.

"The Subtle art of floccinaucinihilipilification is not the most worthwile usage of ones time.  Occasional recalcitrance and perennial procrastination are two of the leading causes for man's path to doom.
The quintessential human finds him/herself drowned in memories of halcyon times, never really focussing on the current task at hand. These are the people in the middle of the great scale of humanity. At moiety. the extremes are:<br/>
1) The Jobless & the Chauvinists (Regional and Linguistic).
2) The Stoic, the Introvert, the Récluse and the Enfant Terrible.

There is a certain point, a limit to which you can speak to yourself in a soto-voce saying 'Congratulations on __ years of worthless existence'. A point at which you better realise the whole rationalé behind it. The fact that you've been percieving the world all wrong. A point at which you'll want to shut yourself away from the world, far from the complex cacophony of sounds, somewhere you can truly find solitude, probably with someone you can find solace in and check whether you had been wired right all along. 

A point to Reflect and Ammend.<br/>
To get a Grasp on Life.

A Symbolic Revolution.<br/>
A Meaningful Achievement.<br/>
A Coup d'état."
